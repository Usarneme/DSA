# Linear Search

Iterate through an array of elements searching for a matching value/element. 

### Java Implementation: 
#### Search each element one at a time in order (e.g.: 0->1->2->3...->length-1) until a match is found. If found, prints the index of the element and the full array searched. If not found, prints element not located and the full array searched.
