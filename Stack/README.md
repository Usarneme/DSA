# Stack

A stack is a data structure comprised of a collection of 0 or more elements. A stack follows the principle of first in, last out and only allows access to the most recently added element.

### JavaScript Implementation
#### The Node function defines a data structure called a Node which consists of a data value and a pointer to the next Node. The Stack function defines a JS prototype called Stack which consists of 0 or more Nodes. A Stack contains functions to push a new Node to the top of the stack, pop which removes the top-most element, and peek which displays the top-most element without removing it from the stack.
