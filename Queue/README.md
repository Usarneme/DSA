# Queue

A queue is a data structure comprised of a collection of 0 or more elements. A queue follows the principle of first in, first out and only thus restricting access to the first/head element.

### JavaScript Implementation
#### The Node function defines a data structure called a Node which consists of a data value and a pointer to the next Node. The Queue function defines a JS prototype called Queue which consists of 0 or more Nodes. A Queue contains functions to enqueue which adds a new node to the end of the queue, dequeue which removes the first element in the queue, and peek which reveals the content of the first element in the queue without modifying or removing it from the queue.
